  * -> internal:
    # This fixes a page with some nasty iframe-related script (an email at i.ua).
    # I didn't understood the problem completely. The script had something about
    # writing <iframe src="">'s contentDocument.innerHtml and setting it's size.
    # And this rule happens to fix it.
