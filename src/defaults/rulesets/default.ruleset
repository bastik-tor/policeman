  # Essentials

  * -> inline: ACCEPT
  internal -> internal: ACCEPT

  internal -> (web|file):
    # allows various thing like navigation from chrome pages to web and
    # iframes on chrome pages (addons page has one)
    # kind of entry point for document load
    [contentType] (DOCUMENT|SUBDOCUMENT): ACCEPT

  web -> web:
    # allows opening links on web pages

  # Compatibility and workarounds

  inline -> *:
    # Jetpack-based addons use 'data:application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml,<window/>'
    # with an iframe for toolbar popups, let's not break that
    [scheme] data -> *:
      # Only allow that for chrome xul data documents
      # Firefox won't load xul in content, so this check makes sence

        [contentType] DOCUMENT: ACCEPT

  * -> internal:
    # This fixes a page with some nasty iframe-related script (an email at i.ua).
    # I didn't understood the problem completely. The script had something about
    # writing <iframe src="">'s contentDocument.innerHtml and setting it's size.
    # And this rule happens to fix it.
    [spec] * -> "about:blank":
      [contentType] (DOCUMENT|SUBDOCUMENT): ACCEPT

    # Fixes KeeFox and probably other addons that comunicate with local services
